Getting Started
---------------

Download and install zipkin (see [Zipkin] homepage), but basically it is:

```
git clone https://github.com/twitter/zipkin.git
cd zipkin
# run in different windows
bin/collector
bin/query
bin/web
```

Then you can use the Kamon playground example to generate some traces.
